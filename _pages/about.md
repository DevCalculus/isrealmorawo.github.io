I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Industrial and Biological Multiphysics Laboratory](https://ibml.mech.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, specializing in the field of complex fluid dynamics. Under the guidance of [Prof. Dana Grecov](https://mech.ubc.ca/dana-grecov/), my research focuses on **Numerical Simulations and Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Liquid Crystal Dynamics and Topological Defects**.

My work aims to push the boundaries of current computational methods by integrating cutting-edge numerical simulations with machine learning techniques to explore the dynamic behaviors of liquid crystalline materials. I am particularly interested in understanding how topological defects influence the macroscopic properties of nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals, and how these defects can be controlled or manipulated for applications in soft matter physics and material design.

At the core of my research is the development of new computational frameworks that allow for efficient simulation of liquid crystal behavior in complex geometries. These models incorporate both the physical laws governing the systems and the data-driven insights provided by machine learning, enabling a deeper understanding of the non-linear dynamics at play. By combining these approaches, I aim to create predictive tools that can inform the design of novel materials with tunable properties for use in displays, sensors, and other advanced technologies.

Outside of my research, I am deeply committed to advancing the field of computational mechanics and contributing to the growing intersection of numerical methods, soft matter physics, and artificial intelligence. My work not only explores fundamental questions in liquid crystal dynamics but also seeks to develop tools that will have broader applications in complex fluid dynamics, biomedical engineering, and materials science.
